This project focuses on the analysis of the bacterial microbiome associated with BLB disease in Thai fragrant rice seeds using 16S rRNA gene of V3 - V4 amplicon sequences.
In this study, we characterized bacterial communities in Thai fragrant rice seeds of Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105, susceptible cultivar) and Pathum Thani 1 (PTT 1, moderately resistant cultivar).
